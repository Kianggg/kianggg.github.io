                                &emsp;&emsp;Yukola was born in Yanrakynnot, a small locality in Chukotka, Russia. She was from a litter of sled puppies, meant to be adopted out to mushers stopping by during the Nadezhda race. She was chosen by a musher named Akhill, who had plans of building a long-distance team. Akhill began Yukola's training immediately, but she proved to be a difficult&mdash;almost impossible&mdash;dog to work with. She would destroy Akhill's gear, constantly bother the other dogs, break formation, and never pay attention during training. Even after being scolded by the older, experienced dogs, her behavior never seemed to improve. With little time left before the next Nadezdha race, Akhill decided she would have to give Yukola up for adoption.<br>
                                &emsp;&emsp;Not wanting to leave her at a shelter, she took her back to Yanrakynnot in search of a new owner. But the timing was terrible as everyone was busy preparing for the race, uninterested in adopting a puppy. Not only that, but Yukola's original breeder wasn't anywhere to be found &mdash; most likely away from town for business. After her fruitless attempts in Yanrakynnot, Akhill gave up hope and decided to take her to a local shelter. But as they were on their way to the shelter, Yukola escaped her grasp and started to bite on the shoes of a stranger. Akhill immediately apologized to the passerby for Yukola's behavior, but they told her not to worry, as they were used to dogs chewing on them.<br>
                                &emsp;&emsp;As the two got acquainted, Akhill learned that the stranger was actually the Ilion musher, who at the time was still new to mushing. They were in Yanrakynnot to volunteer as a veterinarian for the race. While they conversed, Akhill noticed how the Ilion musher was able to calm Yukola down from her usual hyperactive self. Believing that she had finally found the perfect owner for Yukola, she asked them if they were interested in adopting her. Without any hesitation, they accepted Yukola, promising to take care of her. Akhill believed in Yukola's potential to become a great sled dog, and she was confident that the Ilion musher would help her shine.

                            <p>
                                &emsp;&emsp;"I was thrilled to bring home Yukola from Chukotka as she was one of the first dogs to be a part of my newly formed team. Akhill mentioned Yukola's wild personality, but I don't think she realized how attached she was to her. When Yukola realized Akhill gave her away, she tried to escape a few times to go back to Russia. Thankfully at the time, my sanctuary was small, so it was easy to Yukola-proof everything. But her homesickness affected her mood drastically, and her "wild" self was the opposite for a while. I spent ample time with her to help her realize that the sanctuary was her new home, and that I would always be there for her. She eventually came around, and her infamous hyper-self finally showed itself. She was challenging to train as she can be unpredictable during training sessions. She's also grown very attached to me and has since developed severe separation anxiety. While some of my other dogs with separation anxiety are good at dealing with me leaving, Yukola will go on rampages, destroying anything she lays her eyes on, or she'll attempt to escape to find me. There's been a few times where I had to go into town for a meeting, and Yukola would be waiting by my car for me. Despite all of this, Yukola is one of my most treasured dogs! She's always hardworking and dependable during actual races, and her passion for it is a reminder of why I became a musher."
