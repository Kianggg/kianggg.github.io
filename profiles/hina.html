                                &emsp;&emsp;Hina is a cheerful and hardworking dog who comes from Hilo, Hawaii. She is supposedly a mutt and grew up on her own as a parentless stray. However, this was hardly an issue for her as she was always quick to make friends with the various animals of Hawaii's forests and mountains while growing up. Through the days of her adolescence, these animals felt like family to her. They were the ones who encouraged her to pursue her dream of becoming a sled dog, which was ultimately what she needed to take the plunge. The thought of racing as part of a team always enamored her, and so she went ahead to spend many years training on the slopes of Mauna Kea, the only place in Hawaii where it snows.<br>
                                &emsp;&emsp;When Hina finally felt that her potential as a sled dog was nothing short of surefire, she hit a dead end when she realized there were no mushing teams in Hawaii. She made attempts to start a team and even plastered fliers all over the city, but nobody responded as there were not many dogs in Hawaii that had a tolerance for the cold like she did. She spent days mulling over what to do, but she found herself completely stumped. As she strolled somberly around the busy streets of downtown Hilo, she saw on a TV screen a broadcast of Alaska's biggest mushing competition. Her eyes twinkled as she saw a segment on the Ilion team and their journey. She decided from there that she would go to Alaska to join the Ilion team. She would do whatever it takes, even if it meant sneaking onto a cargo ship and not seeing land for several weeks.<br>
                                &emsp;&emsp;Exhausted and hungry by the time she finally made it, Hina stood at the gate of the Ilion sanctuary, a nervous mess. Yet, she still bravely professed her desire to become part of the team. Concerned for Hina's wellbeing, Ilion's sympathetic musher immediately took her in. She explained her story to the musher and how she traveled from Hawaii to join their team. The musher felt flattered and amazed, immediately welcoming her onto the team.

                                &emsp;&emsp;"I was surprised when Hina showed up at the gates of the sanctuary. Not only did she travel on a cargo ship for weeks, but she's from a place that I would've never suspected to have snow! When she expressed her interest in racing, I thought maybe she was a bit confused from the trip, having not had proper rest or food for weeks. But no, when she was well-rested and fed, she continued to beg me to join the team. Even though I was a bit concerned about her tolerance for the cold, I decided to let her join. If a dog wants to join the team and is full of spirit, then there's no way I can deny them of that. But to my surprise, her cold tolerance is one of the best! It seems her training in the mountains of Hawaii paid off. Her passion and energy for racing made her a candidate for lead dog on the long-distance team. The moment I announced in front of everyone that she might be our new long-distance lead, she almost burst into flamesâ€”her face was so red! Despite her energetic and friendly attitude, she hates being on the spot. Thankfully she's happy with being a team dog cause It's what she wanted to be all along!"
